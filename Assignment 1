1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application? (2 points)
Initial thoughts include planning out how we are going to retrieve data, both about the current fuel prices (maybe from API's) and data from the user through an easy to use GUI. Data from the user will include both the information to register/login and the data to actually use the application. There will be a datadase used to hold user info like client history and login info.

2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why? (2 points)
We chose to go with the waterfall model. This is not a big project so using a simple model can simplify things. Also with the way the assignemnts are structured it goes well with
the waterfall model.

3. Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing? (6 points)
