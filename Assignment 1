1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application? (2 points)
Initial thoughts include planning out how we are going to retrieve data, both about the current fuel prices (maybe from API's) and data from the user through an easy to use GUI. Data from the user will include both the information to register/login and the data to actually use the application. There will be a datadase used to hold user info like client history and login info.

2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why? (2 points)
We chose to go with the waterfall model. This is not a big project so using a simple model can simplify things. Also with the way the assignemnts are structured it goes well with
the waterfall model since the requirements are clearly listed. The components described to us in the assignments gives us an idea of what the application must consist of when the user attemps to use it. 

3. Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing? (6 points)
We decided to model the software using the Activity Diagram because operation that the user uses can become a new activity that will continue to go into another activity until the user is finished using the software.

Who did what: We all came up with the answers together an Nathan drew the UML diagram.
